# Hackathon-5-2020

This repository is designed to create a functional project that creates a blockchain application that does the following:
  1) Creates unique hash id's that are used to identify each block.
  2) Verifies chains and block creation.
  3) Allows multiple chains to be made, syncing data regularly for all users.
